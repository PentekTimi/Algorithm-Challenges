The objective is to return all pairs of integers from a given array of integers that have a difference of 2.<br>

The result array should be sorted in ascending order of values.<br>

Assume there are no duplicate integers in the array. The order of the integers in the input array should not matter.<br>
Examples<br>

[1, 2, 3, 4] should return [[1, 3], [2, 4]]<br>

[4, 1, 2, 3] should also return [[1, 3], [2, 4]]<br>

[1, 23, 3, 4, 7] should return [[1, 3]]<br>

[4, 3, 1, 5, 6] should return [[1, 3], [3, 5], [4, 6]]<br>
