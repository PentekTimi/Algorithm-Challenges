An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.<br>

Example: (Input --> Output)<br>

"Dermatoglyphics" --> true "aba" --> false "moOse" --> false (ignore letter case)<br>

isIsogram "Dermatoglyphics" = true<br>
isIsogram "moose" = false<br>
isIsogram "aba" = false
