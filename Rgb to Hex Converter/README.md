The rgb function is incomplete. Complete it so that passing in RGB decimal values will result in a hexadecimal representation being returned. Valid decimal values for RGB are 0 - 255. Any values that fall out of that range must be rounded to the closest valid value.

Note: Your answer should always be 6 characters long, the shorthand with 3 will not work here. <br>
Examples (input --> output): <br>

255, 255, 255 --> "FFFFFF" <br>
255, 255, 300 --> "FFFFFF" <br>
0, 0, 0 --> "000000" <br>
148, 0, 211 --> "9400D3" <br>
