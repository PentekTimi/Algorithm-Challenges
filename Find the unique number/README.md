There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!<br>

findUniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) === 2<br>
findUniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) === 0.55<br>

Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.<br>

The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.
