Given a string indicating a range of letters, return a string which includes all the letters in that range, including the last letter.<br>
Note that if the range is given in capital letters, return the string in capitals also!<br>
Examples<br>

"a-z" ➞ "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"<br>
"h-o" ➞ "hijklmno"<br>
"Q-Z" ➞ "QRSTUVWXYZ"<br>
"J-J" ➞ "J"<br>

Notes<br>

    A hyphen will separate the two letters in the string.<br>
    You don't need to worry about error handling in this kata (i.e. both letters will be the same case and the second letter will not be before the first alphabetically).
