Your task is to write a function that takes two arguments n, m and returns a sorted array of all numbers from n to m inclusive, which have only 3 divisors (1 and the number itself are not included).<br>
Example:<br>

solution(2, 20) -> [16]<br>

16 has 3 divisors: 2, 4, 8 (1 and 16 aren't included)<br>
Input:

    n - integer
    m - integer

Output:

    result - array of integers
