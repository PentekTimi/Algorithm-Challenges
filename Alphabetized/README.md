The alphabetized kata<br>

Re-order the characters of a string, so that they are concatenated into a new string in "case-insensitively-alphabetical-order-of-appearance" order. Whitespace and punctuation shall simply be removed!<br>

The input is restricted to contain no numerals and only words containing the english alphabet letters.<br>

Example:<br>

alphabetized("The Holy Bible") // "BbeehHilloTy"<br>
