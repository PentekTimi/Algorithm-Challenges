Circle area inside square<br>

Turn an area of a square in to an area of a circle that fits perfectly inside the square.<br>

Your function gets a number which represents the area of the square and should return the area of the circle. The tests are rounded by 8 decimals to make sure multiple types of solutions work.<br>

You don't have to worry about error handling or negative number input: area >= 0.<br>

This kata might be simpler than you expect, but good luck!
