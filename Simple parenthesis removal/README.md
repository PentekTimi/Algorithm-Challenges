In this Kata, you will be given a expression string and your task will be to remove all braces as follows:<br>

solve("x-(y+z)") = "x-y-z"<br>
solve("x-(y-z)") = "x-y+z"<br>
solve("u-(v-w-(x+y))-z") = "u-v+w+x+y-z"<br>
solve("x-(-y-z)") = "x+y+z"<br>

There are no spaces in the expression. Only two operators are given: "+" or "-".<br>

More examples in test cases.<br>

Good luck!<br>
