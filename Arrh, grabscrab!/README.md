Pirates have notorious difficulty with enunciating. They tend to blur all the letters together and scream at people.<br>

At long last, we need a way to unscramble what these pirates are saying.<br>

Write a function that will accept a jumble of letters as well as a dictionary, and output a list of words that the pirate might have meant.<br>

For example:

    grabscrab( "ortsp", ["sport", "parrot", "ports", "matey"] )

    Should return ["sport", "ports"].

Return matches in the same order as in the dictionary. Return an empty array if there are no matches.<br>

Good luck!
